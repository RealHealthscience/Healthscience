                    <h3>What is Breast Cancer?</h3>
                    <p>Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. The tumor is malignant (cancerous) if the cells can grow into surrounding tissues or spread to distant areas of the body.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Early Detection</h3>
                    <p>Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment. Regular screenings, including mammograms and clinical breast exams, can help detect cancer in its early stages when it's most treatable. Women aged 40 and older should have mammograms every 1-2 years.</p>
